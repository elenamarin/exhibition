  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>I wrote a poem based on a child labor photo of my choosing and created a mixed media collage, after that I wrote an artist's statment of my poem and collage. I did the same for my Social Media + Art subject.</p>
  
  <h2>Child Labor Photo</h2>

  <h2>Child Labor Poem</h2>
  <h3>Little Girl</h3>
  <p>Little girl working hard everyday</p>
  <p>Little girl wakes up early this morning to get to work, she’s ten</p>
  <p>Little girl comes to work wearing a worn out dress, dirty boots, and an apron, she’s barely getting by</p>
  <p>Little girl goes inside the store with only a few coins in her hand, she’s starving</p>
  <p>Little girl comes to a place that she calls home, a little hovel on the street, no one welcomes her home</p>
  <p>Little girl cries until she sleeps, waiting until the nightmares are over</p>

  <h2>Child Labor Artist's Statement</h2>
  <p>I have eight pictures scattered across a blank sheet of a beige yellow paper. I picked a picture of a tunnel of books because it found it beautiful and childish as a kid should be, a kid who is going down a path of life and doesn’t know where they’re going. A picture of a girl that seems to be floating, it represents the girl of my poem. Flowers of meadows the kids should be playing in. A picture of a girl alone in her room, hoping for someone to come back home. Creepy crawlies hidden in her nightmares, she wants it to be over. A bird for hopes that she would one day be free of her labor. All over the collage are words to my poem, Little Girl, which sort of leads a path to the story I am trying to tell.</p>
  <p>The order of the photos are sort of zigzagging and glued over each other. I also painted a layer of mod podge over the mixed media collage to make it look shiny. I wrote words to my poem last.</p>
  
  <h2>Social Media + Art Poem</h2>
  <p>Art, art, art…</p>
  <p>In a museum or at the tip of my fingers</p>
  <p>On the walls of a building or a click of the button</p>
  <p>Does it really matter?</p>
  <p>They are all the same,</p>
  <p>in person or not,</p>
  <p>Beautiful no matter what the distance between me and the art.</p>
  <p>What matters if it is only a push-of-a-button photo of a beautiful painting or the real life thing?</p>
  <p>Art is beautiful electronically or not.</p>
  <p>I can see it with my own eyes at the museum or at home.</p>
  <p>They are both insanely awesome.</p>
  
  <h2>Social Media + Art Mixed Media Collage</h2>

  <h2>Social Media + Art Artist's Statement</h2>
  <p>In my collage, I drew a picture on an iPhone in the middle and drew a “painting” inside it and wrote lines to my poem around it in different types of writing to show how I felt. My poem and artwork relates to my topic because I believe that a painting’s beauty will stay the same whether you see it in person or not, you should just be proud that the artist’s work is still being respected and shared with many people who care about this person’s work. The point of my poem is that it doesn’t matter whether you are at home on your phone or at the museum enjoying the quiet, the piece of work that the artist crafted would still be immortally beautiful.</p>
