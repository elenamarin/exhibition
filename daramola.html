  <p>(Start of Interview)</p>
  <p>Interviewer: My name is Elena Marin. I’m fifteen years old. The date is January 24, 2018, and I’m sitting with my father, Juan Marin, in his living room in Inglewood, Los Angeles, California.Interviewee: I am Juan Marin, I’m forty-three years old. Today is January 24, 2018, and I’m sitting with my daughter, Elena Marin, in the city of Inglewood, California.Interviewer: I’m going to ask you a few questions regarding where you grew up, your childhood and family, and important things from your life. Understood?</p>
  <p>Interviewee: Yes.</p>
  <p>Interviewer: Alright, I’m going to get started. When and where were you born?</p>
  <p>Interviewee: When I born April 3rd, 1974 in Puebla, Mexico.</p>
  <p>Interviewer: What was your childhood like?</p>
  <p>Interviewee: It was… rough…</p>
  <p>Interviewer: Can you explain more?</p>
  <p>Interviewee: No, it was a real nice childhood. I remember when I was maybe 10-12 years old. I remember when I went to kindergarten and they make us do some stuff I don’t like. I remember my first days of elementary I don’t like to go to school. I go to trips somewhere… different places in Mexico with my mom who would take us everywhere. And most of what I remember was when I was already older. Like eleven years old, I remembered that I was learning how to drive a car and started helping </p>
  <p>Interviewer: Where is your mom’s family from? Where is your dad’s family from?</p>
  <p>Interviewee: From Mexico, Puebla too.</p>
  <p>Interviewer: What are the most important lessons you’ve learned in life?  Where did these events happen?</p>
  <p>Interviewee: When I was twelve years old, I remember my brother get mad at my mom because my mom was kind of strict. And I remember my brother make… make… making my mom feel bad and I didn’t like that. I remember I wasn’t thinking about that… I mean I don’t think in the same way as my brother and my brother was older. When my brother finished… I mean when we were by ourselves my brother was like: “Did you see how I talked to mom?” And I told my brother, “Yeah I saw how you talked to mama and you don’t respect mom… you don’t respect mom, and I don’t like it. I don’t--I don’t share the same thing… I don’t share the same views as you thinking of mom. Next time you talk to mom, you need to speak more respectful to mom.” You know, the whole point is, since I was little, I know the difference between being good person and bad person with my parents.</p>
  <p>Interviewer: How has your life been different than what you’ve imagined?</p>
  <p>Interviewee: Well, it change because you’re grown up and you have more responsibilities. And it’s not the same thing when you’re young people. When you’re your adults, you have more responsibilities, you have to work to pay the mortgage to pay expensives. Though, I don’t know if that’s what you mean with that...</p>
  <p>Interviewer: What is a moment in history that you personally remember?  Why?</p>
  <p>Interviewee: For example, earthquakes. When I was in Mexico, I felt the first big earthquake in September, I forget the year, I think it was 1996? When I started living here in USA, California, I felt the earthquake in Northridge, it was really big too. So some of those things happened to me, like when I go back on vacation to Mexico recently, on last September 2017, the other earthquake. You know, I was… I already been in three big earthquakes. So that’s what I remember. And I think it was also here in 1992? It was the disturbs in Los Angeles… I used to work in 7-11. In those days--in the 7-11 where I used to work--they go and destroy the 7-11. They vandalized and destroyed that place. </p>
  <p>Interviewer: How would would you describe your experience living in Los Angeles for the past few years? How was it different from living in Mexico?</p>
  <p>Interviewee: Well the difference here is the big city and maybe the difference is… I can really tell the difference because I’m here in Los Angeles--well, we’re living in Inglewood--I come here when I was sixteen-seventeen years old. So pretty much more of my life i live in Inglewood, LA. I know over there it was more hard for people to get really good wages, so here is more easier to make more money. There are more opportunities. </p>
  <p>Interviewer: Do you miss life back in Mexico where you used to live?</p>
  <p>Interviewee: No, not really. I like to go over there, but just like going on vacationing or just go to visit my family. But I don’t really miss it. I like to live here in California.</p> 
  <p>Interviewer: Thank you for your time, this interview is over. </p>
