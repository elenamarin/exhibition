    <h2>What is the Coding the Past Project?</h2>
    <p>My name is Elena Marin. This is a website that shows all of my work from the past projects from this semester. Our class was assigned to interview a person of our choice who is eighteen or older and get information on who they are and pieces of history they were a part of. I created a transcript and recorded what the interviewer (me) and the interviewee (dad) was saying. Also created a coded map of the things and places the interviewee had been. In Noelâ€™s class, I made a subject-layered portrait of this person, a reflection of why I did the subject layered portrait, and a three page essay on a topic they had talked about during their interview.</p>
