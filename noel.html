	<p>Layered Subject Portrait Reflection<p>
	<p>Last week, our English 10 class had created a layered subject portrait, a collage of photos that emphasizes the life and personality of the person we interviewed in our Coding the Past project. My layered subject portrait focused on my dad, Juan Marin.</p>
	<p>The photos in the layered subject portrait contained things that my dad likes, what represents him as a person, and places that are important to him. He likes playing poker and he listens to a lot of bands. My dad had met my mom at Pizza Hut and he works as a mechanic and also fixes houses. I added the church from his hometown, the picture of the entrance of his childhood home, a place we went to for vacation (Puerto Vallarta), and a picture of where we live.</p>
	<p>My dad had experienced two huge earthquakes in Mexico, including the Northridge earthquake in California. Most of the pictures don’t connect to the historic moment except the pictures including the church and the entrance to his childhood home, because he was in his hometown (San Miguel Xoxtla, Puebla) when two of the earthquakes hit. Other than that, none of the other pictures don’t connect with the historic moments my dad had witnessed or had been a part of.</p>
	<p>I didn’t exactly put any of the pictures in any order or enlarged or shrunken them to make some sort of symbolism, it was really rushed and incomplete. I didn’t have the chance to finish my layered subject portrait so I didn’t think of it at the time.</p>


  <h2>SOMETHING about EARTHQUAKES Essay</h2>
  <p>An essay based on the topics that my dad, Juan Marin had talked about in the interview, he talked about earthquakes, so I made an essay about them.</p>
